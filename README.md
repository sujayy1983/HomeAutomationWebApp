### Why this app ?
    As part of learning golang this is a rewrite of python webapp.  This rewrite leverages websockets for improved user experience. 

### Features

##### BoseSoundtouch    (implemented)
##### Virtual Doorbell  (implemented)  
##### Home network map  (To be implemented)

### Drawbacks
This app is very naive at this point. Certain paths and IPs are hardcoded and this app lacks configuration file.
